/*
Diagrams
- Every diagram should have a title describing the type and scope of the diagram
  (e.g., "System Context Diagram for My Software System").
- Every diagram should have a key/legend explaining the notation used
  (e.g., shapes, colors, border styles, line types, arrow, etc).
- Acronyms and abbreviations (business/domain or technology) should be understandable to
  all audiences or explained in the diagram key/legend.
